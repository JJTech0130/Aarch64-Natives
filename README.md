# [LEGACY] Aarch64-Natives
> Warning: These natives are just here for reference, they are not very useful anymore as my fork of the open-source Minecraft launcher *MultiMC* [here](https://github.com/JJTech0130/MultiMC5) is still actively worked on and is much more useful than these natives.

These are the natives needed for LWJGL 2, mainly for Minecraft versions less then 1.13, built for Aarch64/.

They are built from the latest commits on [this](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl) repository.
